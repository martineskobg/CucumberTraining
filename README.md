# Java-simple-project.

### This is a Java project created for training purpose.

#### Description

I've created this program to gain experience with "Cucumber", "BDD" and JUnit.
In this project I have a single scenario (in feature file) with 3 steps.
It prints "Hello World!" and asserts if the message is ok.

#### Instructions
You can run the test by following the steps below:
1. Go to src directory of the project
2. Than open test --> runner
3. And run TestRunner.java class

NOTE. you can run the test from the HelloWorld.feature file placed in resource folder.
